* Watch for changes

	Watch specific keys or directories for changes and react to changes in values

## About

etcd is a strongly consistent, distributed key-value store that provides a reliable way to store data that needs to be accessed by a distributed system or cluster of machines. It gracefully handles leader elections during network partitions and can tolerate machine failure, even in the leader node.

Applications of any complexity, from a simple web app to Kubernetes, can read data from and write data into etcd.

Your applications can read from and write data into etcd. A simple use case is storing database connection details or feature flags in etcd as key-value pairs. These values can be watched, allowing your app to reconfigure itself when they change. Advanced uses take advantage of etcdâ€™s consistency guarantees to implement database leader elections or perform distributed locking across a cluster of workers.

etcd is open source, available on GitHub, and backed by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation.
